Apoptosis Necroptosis Reaction Model

-----???http://sorgerlab.github.com/earm???-----

ANRM is a family of models of the TNF apoptosis and necroptosis pathways written 
using the Python modeling framework PySB. Model variants focus on exploring
alternative hypotheses for the involvement of Bid in suppressing RIP1 mediated
necroptosis.
